# Zendesk AI Copilot

[This application provides an AI-driven agent experience that performs cognitive services on case data, powered by a Large Language Model and Natural Language Processing functions]

### Version 1.0 is the first version of the production application.  The features enabled in this version are:

* Case Summarization:  Provides a summary of all of the case correspondence within two paragraphs
* Information Retrieval:  Provides the ability for the Support Agent to type in a question about Vonage applications, products and services, and receive a short answer to the question as well as relevant links
* Copy and Paste:  The Agent can copy and paste the responses (links and answer)
* Feedback loop:  This version has a feedback loop that will allow us to track utilization of the app, including copying of the answers (tracker) and also whether or not the case summary hit the mark.  

Please submit bug reports to [tim.dentry@vonage.com ](). Pull requests are welcome.
